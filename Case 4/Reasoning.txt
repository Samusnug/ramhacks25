Jordan is our main suspect due to his ping right before the person of interests disappearance  and being in the same area, cameras also showed a person with a backpack leaving which matches with the timeline of jordans ping and he would know the layout of everything wouldn't be suspicious when traveling the area due to his job and he was said to be on patrol with no logs and the card logs show he exited the subway only 5 minutes after alex vanished and only one stop after university station suggesting he boarded at university with alex and got off alone.
