we believe its Shannon Jones due to there camera footage of a bicycle arriving and exiting linden street break ins on march 3 and 4, so the perp must of been on bike and Shannon has her own 
bike due to her occupation as rideshare biker so she routinely rides, she has no current alibi as well so nothing helping her case there, there was plenty of phone pings for multiple devices
but her device was one of the few that had no pings making it sus, on the fifth she stole the bike and this matches the pattern of a cyclist arriving and departing from the scene.
she had the means of a bike with no logs attached for the first 2 days and the opportunity with unverified whereabouts and no phone record.
